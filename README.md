# GameTime/Family Feud

GameTime is a two week project for Front End Engineering students at the Turing School of Software & Design. Students are assigned to small project groups, which are then given a TV gameshow to create using Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming.

This game was built from a small starter kit using JavaScript, HTML/SCSS, Illustrator, and Mocha/Chai. This project is also the first at Turing to use the fetch API for data and the webpack module bundler. Students were challenged to look for a use case for parent/child class inheritance. 

Our version of the game was inspired by the 1987 ShareData PC game. [View Original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfgCp0Rx2bQ)
